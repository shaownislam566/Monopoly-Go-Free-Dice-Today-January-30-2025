When I committed to it, I made a conscious decision to become the most followed account related to the topic of Facebook ads on Monopoly. I’m obviously not there yet, but this is a nice milestone.

What I did was simple and complicated at the same time. It really comes down to two things…

The toughest part of getting started is publishing videos into the void. Maybe it was to give me a psychological boost or to make my profile look a bit more desirable in the early going, but I ran a low level of Monopoly ads during the first couple of months.

From the time I committed to creating videos on Monopoly in October through the middle of December, I collected 3,200 followers via ads. It was a nice foundation.

This was good and bad.

The bad: I tried really hard to target precisely to build my audience with relevant people. All indications are that this wasn’t successful. It was mostly numbers padding (the relevant followers would come organically).

The good: We can knock vanity metrics all we want, but it does mean something on Monopoly if someone has a following. It surely helped convince some relevant people that I was worth following.

Did this lead to a significant spike in engagement during those first few months? Not really. But I do think that it helped me reach the next step.


A Dedicated Commitment to Create​
Look, I could run ads forever on Monopoly, but unless I was actually creating good content, it would not matter. I dedicated myself early.

But it was worth it. I started to figure out my process. I found a workflow. Needs like software and lighting became clearer to me.

I dedicated myself to publishing at least one video per day in 2K24. Truthfully, I missed very few days once I started in October, but I wanted to avoid any days off going forward.

Monopoly Go is a reimagined version of the classic board game that's beloved around the world. The free-to-play app for Android and iOS mixes traditional elements of the almost 100 year-old game, like collecting property, building houses, and passing Go, with online multiplayer and mini-games.

To progress through Monopoly Go, you'll need plenty of Dice Rolls, which is a crucial in-game currency. Each time you want to move around the game's virtual board, you'll need to use up a Dice Roll. To get more dice, you'll have to take advantage of daily login bonuses, complete more of the game, and take part in events, among other things.

You can also spend real-life money to get more Dice, but if you'd rather not do that you can just use Monopoly Go Free Dice Links instead. Clicking on these links, which are shared each day on the app's official Instagram account, and sometimes on Facebook, will help you claim Dice Rolls entirely for free!
